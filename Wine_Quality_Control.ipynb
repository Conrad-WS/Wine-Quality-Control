Let´s say that we carry out on a daily basis random quality control tests on samples of wines we receive from the producers. The spreadsheet we are going to be working with today is comprised from all these past tests that we have carried out. Let´s have a look."

We can then use those categorizes for lots of things, like market research (finding different groups of customers unique to your business), for technical support (what are the different sort of queries received), or for re-organizing our stock of products ( like in our case with wine).

Now that we have this list of wines that supposedly share something common, we physically go to our warehouse and pull out the wines of these categories and see what they have seem to have in common. It could be all sorts of things, maybe the wines from each category are from a different type of grape (*Chablis*, *Chardonnay*, etc.), or maybe they come from a different region (*South America*, *North America*, *European*) or maybe they are from a different. Whatever it is, there should be some sort of commonality that jumps out and that explains why the algorithm seperated it so.\n",

Rather impressive, and this is fantastic, because quality is related to price. Which means that our algorithm is able, in our fictional exmaple, to discriminate by quality and we can use to set our pricing for our wine! So we can now automate our pricing process!\n",

For example our column has 11 columns, which means it needs to be represented in ***11-D***. This is impossible to do for our feeble human brain but thankfully, it is something that computers find very easy to do.
